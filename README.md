# computational_face_recognition
## by Jonas Knappitsch, 2020

### Dependencies
- **opencv** (pip3 install opencv-python)
- **face_recognition** (pip3 install face_recognition)

The **face_recognition** package provides us with cutting-edge face-recognition functionality, thanks to its usage of dlib, a modern C++ toolkit for machine-learning based image processing and machine vision.

This project supports face recognition in order to classify unknown images based on known images.
Furthermore, persons can even be identified on a live-video-stream via OpenCV.

In a broader sense, this can be used in various security or identification systems.
Known persons can be differentiated from unknown persons, further actions can be based on that.
